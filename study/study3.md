# look around

studies 1 & 2 covered the essential basic techniques of nest_ structures. we measured the depth of a lake - now is a good time to step back and observe the width (though, I like to think of nest_ as a network of underwater caves).

the library affordances are split into three option modules, operating 

| module       | hardware | key-value pairs | groups |
| ---          | ---  | ---      |
| `grid` | grid | `g = grid.connect(n)` | `_grid` |
