# Hello, nest_!

oh hello, I didn't hear to come in. well, let's get started then. `core` is where things begin. nothing here is really useful on it's own - just like that grid you have there on the desk with nothing plugged in into it! no, these are the _building blocks_ of an interface. we leave the _doing things_ to be filled in by later modules. come, have a seat, grab yourself one of those yuzu teas I left by the door.
