musical demo script

128 grid, screen, arc

molly the polly: tuned to a nice patch + a few choice macro controls on arc/grid (filter, glide, envelope shapes)
every other parameter editable on screen w/ the power of _txt.enc.control. also put the macros on the screen
presets!
pattern recorded grid keyboard, pentatonic scales or maybe use the _etc.et12_ nest on screen

2x softcut voices, phase polls drawn to grid & arc (use wardn) mlr-jumps & subloops
pitch glide controls on grid (+ bends on arc ? or maybe loop boundaries for one of the voices)
maybe share the buffer region, so it's just a crazy delay

demo deep saving functionality: ship nest_ w/ a load state for twigs w/ presets & a pattern playing
